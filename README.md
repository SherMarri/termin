- This code is specific to German Consulate Karachi, Pakistan, you may have to edit the URL and HTML parsing for the target consulate.
- The script uses a paid captcha solving service called Anti-captcha (Google it), so you must create an account.
- You must also hide behind a proxy to avoid getting banned, so use a proxy service (like proxyrack).
- Create a .env file with actual secrets/credentials required for running the script.
- Also, please remember that the websites change frequently, so this HTML parsing may not work, adjust accordingly.
- You can either run it locally on your computer running periodically or host a scheduled execution on cloud, your choice.
